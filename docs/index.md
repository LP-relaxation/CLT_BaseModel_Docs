# City-level Transmission (CLT) Base Model

> ***The CLT base model is a mathematical framework and modular codebase for scalable compartmental models of respiratory virus transmission in a city. This model is written by the [Meyers Lab](http://www.bio.utexas.edu/research/meyers/) and [epiENGAGE center](https://www.cdc.gov/insight-net/php/implementers/index.html).***



Documentation is created by Linda Pei ("LP"). Base model code is created by LP in collaboration with Shuotao "Sonny" Diao, Remy Pasco, and Emily Javan, and with supervision from Dave Morton and Lauren Meyers. Special thanks to Cary Murray for generous guidance on software engineering design.
